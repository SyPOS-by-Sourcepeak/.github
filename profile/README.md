# SyPOS

SyPOS is a modern, modular point of sale and inventory management platform built to help retail teams keep sales moving while staying on top of stock. This repository houses organization-level documentation, shared configuration, and community guidance for all SyPOS projects.

## What We Do

- Deliver a unified POS experience that works online and offline
- Track product inventory, suppliers, and purchase orders in real time
- Surface analytics to guide restocking, promotions, and staffing
- Offer extensible integrations for payments, accounting, and ecommerce

## Product Pillars

- **Retail Ready**: Touch-friendly interfaces, fast lookup, split payments, smart receipt flows, and cashier workflows that stay usable even during network hiccups.
- **Inventory Intelligence**: SKU-level insights, reorder automation, low-stock alerts, and batch operations for warehouses or multi-store retailers.
- **Open & Extensible**: Microservice APIs, integration hooks, and shared component libraries so teams can tailor SyPOS to their stack.
- **Insight Driven**: Dashboard widgets and scheduled reports that translate real-time sales and inventory data into action.
